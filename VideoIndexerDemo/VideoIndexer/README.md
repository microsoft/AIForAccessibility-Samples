# Video Indexer Demo Python API

This directory provides the API layer for the video indexer demo. More specifically, it interfaces with Azure video indexer and computer vision services, besides introducing some custom logic to improve the performance for this specific scenario. Note that this custom logic is only meant to demonstrate one approach, and does not necessarily represent the best or the ideal approach which may change depending on the scenario.

## Prerequisites

You need Python 3 to work with demo. We recommend Python 3.6 or higher. 

## Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt
